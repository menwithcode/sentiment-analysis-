# ðŸ¤– Emotion Classification with Self-Healing LangGraph DAG

This project fine-tunes a DistilBERT-based emotion classifier on a multi-label emotion dataset and builds a self-healing pipeline using LangGraph. If the primary model fails (low confidence), it switches to a zero-shot fallback model and retrains dynamically when enough uncertain data is collected.
